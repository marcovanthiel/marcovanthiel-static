Changing business processes, innovation and motivation, these are the key words that apply to me.

With over twenty years of experience in ICT management and consultancy, I work as an interim manager, project manager, program manager, information manager and strategic advisor. I led an ICT service company as director/owner for 10 years.

I have experience in change management, including merger and acquisition consultancy, and post-merger situations in a broad context of companies, industry, education, government, healthcare and both multinationals and SMEs.
